{"name":"Unofficial.nectar.notes","tagline":"Unofficial Nectar Notes","body":"### Why\r\nSometimes it is hard to decide where to put things. We have an internal wiki which is quick and easy to edit, but I want\r\nsomething that everyone can edit.\r\n\r\n### Email\r\nSometimes people want their instances on the Nectar Research cloud to receive email. I believe (and this is why it is unofficial)\r\nthat all nodes block inbound port 25, and that some of them also block outbound 25, and require you to use an institution's\r\noutbound mail server instead. I am not sure why port 25 inbound is blocked.\r\n\r\n### Other Sources of information\r\n* https://support.nectar.org.au (Official support site and documentation)\r\n* https://support.rc.nectar.org.au (Old support site)\r\n* https://github.com/Nectar-RC\r\n* https://nectar.org.au/ (Brochureware)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
